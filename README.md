# Gatsby Material Album

I was really impressed with the way Gatsby created blogs dynamically via Markdown files.

So I figured why not apply the same logic to images in a gallery?

This starter uses the gatsby-node.js file to create a new page for every image, and creates custom node fields from their exif data.
